# Usability Design for Websites Final Project

## Class Background
[ICT 4515 - Usability Design for Websites](https://universitycollege.du.edu/courses/coursesdetail.cfm?degreecode=ict&coursenum=4515) is a required concentration course for University of Denver - University College's [Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology](https://universitycollege.du.edu/ict/degree/masters/web-design-and-development-online/degreeid/400). This course explores usability design in web applications through the lens of human factors engineering and psychology (e.g., visual perception, cognition, learning, and memory). The effectiveness of the UX/UI strategy is examined with a usability studies of student-designed websites. 

## Project Information
My [final project](https://feldbot.github.io/MS-ICT-Usability-Design-for-Websites/) was to build a high-fidelity website wireframe for a usability study. I created a portfolio website of my design work as the subject for the study. A usability study was then conducted to observe the navigational, communicative, and aesthetic effectiveness of the site. The study was conducted among 5 co-workers, capturing their navigational patterns and commentary as they performed a series of common user tasks. The data were then compared to identify areas for improvement. 

This was a favorite project in my master's work. I found the subject matter fascinating since designers don't typically analyze the psychology and mechanics of how people use websites and digest information. I really enjoyed the process of building a test project, gathering feedback, and challenging my own assumptions of how well my website would work for users. Many surprises were revealed which has since sold me on the validity of incorporating usability studies into the design process.
