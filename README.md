# Usability Design for Websites Final Project

## Class Background
[ICT 4515 - Usability Design for Websites](https://universitycollege.du.edu/courses/coursesdetail.cfm?degreecode=ict&coursenum=4515) is a required concentration course for University of Denver - University College's [Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology](https://universitycollege.du.edu/ict/degree/masters/web-design-and-development-online/degreeid/400). This course explores usability design in web applications through the lens of human factors engineering and psychology (e.g., visual perception, cognition, learning, and memory). The effectiveness of the UX/UI strategy is examined with a usability studies of student-designed websites. 

## Project Information
My final project was to build a high-fidelity wireframe of a portfolio website of my own work for usability studies. The wireframe website was then used for a usability study to gauge its navigational, communicative, and aesthetic effectiveness. My study was tested among 5 co-workers as I captured their behavior and comments as they performed a series of user tasks. The data were then compared to isolate where areas for improvement were found. 

This was a favorite project in my master's work. I found the subject matter fascinating since designers don't typically analyze the psychology and mechanics of how people digest web-delivered information. I really enjoyed the process of building a test project, gathering feedback, and challenging my own assumptions of how well my website would work for users.
